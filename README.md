Hi! I'm a software engineer from Boston, a University of Rochester grad, and a current TDP at M&T Bank in Buffalo NY. I'm interested in full-stack development, music and the environment. I know my way around Angular and React, as well as server-side Node and Python. I'm not afraid to plug into a new API, configure a server, or learn a new language. In the future I'm seeking to explore IOT and ways in which tech can benefit our natural environment.

Things I'm working on:
- [Trending Google Searches, a Chrome extension](https://tommygeiger.com/trending-google-searches)
- [Tuner, a Spotify web app](https://tommygeiger.com/tuner)
- [PromoParlor, an industry specific Discourse forum](https://promoparlor.com)

Past accomplishments (no longer live):
- End-to-end COVID-19 screening solution for a local non-profit, with email notifications and mobile dashboard (javascript, google APIs)
- K-means predictive model for CitiBike ride destinations in NYC (python, sklearn)
- Recipe database search engine with ingredient and keyword search (php, html, css)
- 3D music visualizer in the Unity game engine (javascript)

What's next:
- Looking to move into an environmental tech job in the Boston area
- Building a stripe powered storefront website for a client
- Starting a music curation brand 👀
