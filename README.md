Hi! I'm a software engineer from Boston, a University of Rochester grad, and a current TDP at M&T Bank in Buffalo NY. I'm interested in full-stack development, music and the environment. I know my way around Angular and React, as well as server-side Node and Python. In the future I'm seeking to explore IOT and how we can use tech to improve our natural environment.

What I've been working on:
- [Trending Google Searches, a Chrome extension for staying in the know](https://tommygeiger.com/trending-google-searches)
- [Tuner, a Spotify web app to improve recommendations](https://tommygeiger.com/tuner)
- [PromoParlor, an industry specific Discourse forum](https://promoparlor.com)

Past accomplishments:
- End-to-end COVID screening solution for a local non-profit, with automated emails and mobile dashboard (javascript, google APIs)
- K-means predictive model for CitiBike ride destinations in NYC (python, sklearn)
- Recipe database search engine with ingredient and keyword search (php, html, css)
- 3D music visualizer in Unity 3D game engine (javascript)

What's next:
- Looking to move into an environmental tech job in the Boston area
- Building a Stripe powered storefront website for a client
- Starting a music curation brand ðŸ‘€
