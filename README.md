I'm a software engineer located in Somerville, Massachusetts currently working for Gainwell Technologies, improving healthcare systems and analytics for the state of Vermont. I'm interested in full-stack development, health, music and the environment. I'm comfortable building user interfaces and APIs in Javascipt, and processing big data with SQL and Python.

Some things I've been working on:
- [Trending Google Searches, a Chrome extension for staying in the know](https://tommygeiger.com/trending-google-searches)
- [Tuner, a Spotify web app to improve recommendations](https://tommygeiger.com/tuner)
- [PromoParlor, an industry specific Discourse forum](https://promoparlor.com)
