I'm a software engineer from Boston, a University of Rochester grad, and a TDP at M&T Bank in Buffalo NY. I'm interested in full-stack development, music, health and the environment. I'm familiar with Angular and React, server side Node and Python, and some data science techniques. In the future I want to explore IOT and how we can use tech to benefit our health and natural environment.
