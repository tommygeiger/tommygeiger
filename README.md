I'm a software engineer from Boston, a University of Rochester grad, and a TDP at M&T Bank in Buffalo NY. I'm interested in full-stack development, music, health and the environment. I'm familiar with Angular and React, server side Node and Python, and some data science techniques. In the future I want to explore IOT and how we can use tech to benefit our health and natural environment.

What I've been working on:
- [Trending Google Searches, a Chrome extension for staying in the know](https://tommygeiger.com/trending-google-searches)
- [Tuner, a Spotify web app to improve recommendations](https://tommygeiger.com/tuner)
- [PromoParlor, an industry specific Discourse forum](https://promoparlor.com)
