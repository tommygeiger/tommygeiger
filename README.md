Hi! I'm a software engineer from Boston, a University of Rochester grad, and a current TDP at M&T Bank in Buffalo NY. I'm interested in full-stack development, music, and the environment. I know my way around Angular and React, as well as server-side JS and Python. I'm not afraid to configure a server, or rapidly pivot to a new language. In the future I'm seeking to explore the realms of IOT and ways tech can benefit our environment.

Things I've been working on:
- [Trending Google Searches, a Chrome extension](https://tommygeiger.com/trending-google-searches)
- [Tuner, a Spotify web app](https://tommygeiger.com/tuner)
- [PromoParlor, an industry specific Discourse forum](https://promoparlor.com)

Past accomplishments (no longer live):
- End-to-end COVID-19 screening solution for a local non-profit, complete with email notifications and a mobile dashboard
- K-means predictive model for CitiBike ride destinations in NYC
- Graphical audio sampler and manipulator built in Max 8
- Recipe database search engine with ingredient and keyword search
- 3D music visualizer in the Unity game engine
