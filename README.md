I'm a software engineer from Boston, a University of Rochester grad, and a TDP at M&T Bank in Buffalo NY. I'm interested in full-stack development, music, and the environment.

Things I've been working on:
- [Trending Google Searches, a Chrome extension](https://tommygeiger.com/trending-google-searches)
- [Tuner, a Spotify web app](https://tommygeiger.com/tuner)
- [PromoParlor, an industry specific Discourse forum](https://promoparlor.com)
